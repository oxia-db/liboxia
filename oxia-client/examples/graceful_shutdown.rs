//! Graceful shutdown: stop producing, drain in-flight operations, then close.
//!
//! `close()` flushes operations already submitted to batches before tearing
//! the client down, and ephemeral records are removed with the session. The
//! application's job is the ordering: (1) stop issuing new operations,
//! (2) wait for in-flight ones, (3) `close()`. Operations still racing a
//! closed client fail with `OxiaError::Closed` — treat that as shutdown, not
//! as an error.
//!
//! Runs until Ctrl-C (or stops by itself after 10 seconds).
